    <strong>Heads up! Read the following, it is very important for your and other's health!</strong>
</p>
<h3>
   Laser Classification:
</h3>
<p>
    Your laser engraver contains a 658nm or 445nm laser diode with an output power greater than 1000mW.
    According to IEC60825 this is a class 4 laser which is capable of causing injury to both
    the eye and skin and will also present a fire hazard if sufficiently high output powers are used.

<h3>Safety Advisory:</h3>
<p>
    Laser products emit intense laser light that can be harmful to the eyes and can cause burning by irradiation.<br/>
    NEVER DIRECT AT THE EYES EVEN AT A DISTANCE REGARDLESS OF LASER CLASS!<br/>
    Everybody in the line of sight must wear appropriate laser safety glasses during the laser operation. <br/>
    Even when wearing laser safety glasses, <strong>never ever</strong> look direct into the laser beam.<br/>
    Be always responsible regarding yourself and others.<br/>
    Always operate your own assembly of the kit under permanent supervision. <br/>
    <strong>Never</strong> leave the device unattended during operation. <br/>
    <strong>Never</strong> put reflecting or mirroring or flammable materials under the laser. <br/>
    <strong>Never</strong> put the machine on a flammable surface. <br/>
    It must be operated only by persons who are aware of the risks and dangers of the operation,
    especially those of class 4 laser light emissions.<br/>
    If not operated by yourself introduce the operating person carefully and responsibly.
    If you are connecting the laser engraver to a network ensure that you properly set up the network access
    as well as the machines access control. Do NOT underestimate the risk of an unsecured access from the internet to your laser engraver.
