Mr Beam Plugin Tests

# General Information

Testing is done with pytest (pytest.org / pip install pytest).
This test folder should organize its test files in a similar structure as the codebase in ../octoprint_mrbeam/
(following best practices of https://blog.ionelmc.ro/2014/05/25/python-packaging/#the-structure "Tests outside packages").

Test case files should follow the pytest naming scheme test_something.py.

Run the tests with

> pytest
> pytest ./gcodegenerator

# Test Resources

Test resources are located in the rsc folder.
Until we don't use wheel for a better installation (where we can select what to install and what not) the test resources should not blow up our repository.
As intermediate solution, the test resources are hosted on a public accessible cloud space. The test script itself downloadeds them on demand.
Therefore a little helper can be found in testutils/
